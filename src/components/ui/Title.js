        Enhances vision â€“ Your eyes translate light into colors. The human
        retina identifies colors between 400 and 700 nanometers, with blue at
        the lowest and red at the highest end of the color spectrum. The color
        green, which is a mixture of blue and yellow, is located at about 550
        nanometers, making it the easiest for the retina to perceive. Since
        green is near the middle of the color spectrum, it enhances the blue and
        red colors at the opposite ends, making them easier to see.
